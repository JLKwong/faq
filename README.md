## Transformers TCG Glossary

### Battlefield

The game area in which the characters in play are placed. 

### Bold [x]

Flip [x] more battle cards when attacking. 

### Black Pip

A black oblong in the right hand corner of a battle card.

When attacking, the number of black pips on the battle cards the attacker flips are added to the overall <a href="#pierce">Pierce</a> until the end of turn. 

Note that adding this to the end of turn means it is still added should the character be able to attack again within the same turn. 

### Blue Pip

A blue oblong in the right hand corner of a battle card.

When defending, the number of blue pips on the battle cards the defender flips are added to the overall defence.

### Deck

Your battle cards are shuffled and placed face down. You draw cards from your deck. As soon as the deck runs out of cards you reshuffle the <a href="#scrap">scrap</a> and that becomes your new deck. 

### Flip (battle card)

The act of taking a battle card from the deck and placing it face up onto the Battlefield. 

### Green Pip

A green oblong in the right hand corner of a battle card.

When battle cards are flipped in either defence or attack, one battle card with a green pip on it may be swapped with a battle card in the player's hand.

### KO (Knock Out)

When a character's damage equals or exceeds its health (including any additional health bonuses), the character is said to be KO'd.

### KO Area

Most KO'd characters are moved to the KO area (see <a href="#battlemaster">Battlemaster</a> and <a href="#weaponizer">Weaponizer</a> for notable exceptons). 

The KO area is usually off to the side of the main battlefield, out of the way of the play but still visible. Note that characters may still be flipped as a part of your flip action, however they cannot be flipped by battle cards unless a card specifically states it can. 

### Orange Pip

An orange oblong in the right hand corner of a battle card.

When attacking, the number of orange pips on the battle cards the attacker flips are added to the overall attack.

### Pierce

TODO: This entry will need careful thought :)

### Pip

An oblong of colour in the right hand corner of a battle card.

### Scrap

Used battle cards are placed face-up in the scrap pile. Either player may examine either scrap pile at any time. As soon as the deck runs out of cards, the scrap pile is shuffled to form the new deck. 

### Tough [x]

Flip [x] more battle cards when defending.
