      <question>
        Who picks their Weapon to scrap first? Who picks a card in their hand to scrap first?
    </question>
      <answer>
        Any time both players are given the same instruction, the player whose turn it is goes first. If you play Collateral Damage, first you&#x2019;ll scrap a Weapon from one of your characters, then your opponent will, then you&#x2019;ll scrap a card from your hand, and finally your opponent will.

      <question>
        Can I play Collateral Damage if none of my characters have a Weapon or if I won&#x2019;t have any other cards in my hand?
    </question>
      <answer>
        Yes. You can always play an Action card, even if you can&#x2019;t carry out some of its instructions. Just do as much as you can.
