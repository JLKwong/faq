      <div class="question">
        If one of my other characters has upgrades and is KO’d, will Sergeant Skrapnel’s ability trigger?
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        Yes. Those upgrades were on a character and were then scrapped, so the ability will trigger.

      <div class="question">
        Say Sergeant Skrapnel has an upgrade and takes damage exactly equal to his health. Can I save Skrapnel using his ability?
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        No. Sergeant Skrapnel is KO’d at the same time his upgrades are scrapped. His ability won’t trigger in time to save him.
