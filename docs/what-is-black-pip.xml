    <question>What is 'Black Pip'?</question>
    <answer>
A black oblong in the right hand corner of a battle card.
When attacking, the number of black pips on the battle cards the attacker flips are added to the overall <a href="#pierce">Pierce</a> until the end of turn. 
Note that adding this to the end of turn means it is still added should the character be able to attack again within the same turn.
