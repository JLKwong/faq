A black oblong in the right hand corner of a battle card.
When attacking, the number of black pips on the battle cards the attacker flips are added to the overall <a href="#pierce">Pierce</a> until the end of turn. 
Note that adding this to the end of turn means it is still added should the character be able to attack again within the same turn.

    <question>What is 'White Pip'?</question>
    <answer>
An white oblong in the right hand corner of a battle card.
When attacking or defending, the first white pip flipped means the player flips two more battle cards. Additional white pips do not lead to more battle cards being flipped unless an effect explicitly states it does.
