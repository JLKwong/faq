    <question>
        What happens if some of my characters are undamaged when I flip Arcee to alt mode?
    </question>
    <answer>
        There are no damage counters to remove, so nothing happens to those characters.

    <question>
        If Arcee’s attack is boosted by actions or Upgrades, does that raise her Piercenumber?
    </question>
    <answer>
        Yes. For example, if you play an action card that gives Arcee +2 attackuntil end of turn, she’ll have Pierce 3.

    <question>
        What happens if Arcee has a Piercing Blaster or another Upgradethat gives her more Pierce?
    </question>
    <answer>
        In that case, Arcee will have Pierceequal to her attack plusthe Piercefrom the Upgrade. In that example, Arcee’s attack is 1, so she’ll have Pierce 4. However, remember that characters with Pierce 
can’t deal more damage than their attack total, so she’ll do only 1 damage (not including other attack bonuses or orange battle icons).
