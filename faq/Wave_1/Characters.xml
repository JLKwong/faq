    <question>
        What happens if some of my characters are undamaged when I flip Arcee to alt mode?
    </question>
    <answer>
        There are no damage counters to remove, so nothing happens to those characters.

    <question>
        If Arcee’s attack is boosted by actions or Upgrades, does that raise her Piercenumber?
    </question>
    <answer>
        Yes. For example, if you play an action card that gives Arcee +2 attackuntil end of turn, she’ll have Pierce 3.

    <question>
        What happens if Arcee has a Piercing Blaster or another Upgradethat gives her more Pierce?
    </question>
    <answer>
        In that case, Arcee will have Pierceequal to her attack plusthe Piercefrom the Upgrade. In that example, Arcee’s attack is 1, so she’ll have Pierce 4. However, remember that characters with Pierce 
can’t deal more damage than their attack total, so she’ll do only 1 damage (not including other attack bonuses or orange battle icons).

    <question>
        If there are two cards left in my deck, and I attack with Autobot Cosmos, will his ability trigger?
    </question>
    <answer>
        Yes. You reshuffle your scrap pile into your deck as soon as the deck is empty. Inthis case, Autobot Cosmos will attack, you’ll flip up the two remaining cards in your deck, and the defender will be KO’d (assuming it has 12 starsor fewer). Your opponent won’t flip any battle cards for the attack if their character is KO’d this way.

    <question>
        Say Autobot Cosmos has a Data Pad. Will Autobot Cosmos’s ability triggerif you draw the last card of your deck while he’s attacking?
    </question>
    <answer>
        Yes. Drawing the last card of your deck will cause you to shuffle your deck, and this will cause Autobot Cosmos to KO the defender.
