    <question>What is 'KO Area'?</question>
    <answer>
Most KO'd characters are moved to the KO area (see <a href="#battlemaster">Battlemaster</a> and <a href="#weaponizer">Weaponizer</a> for notable exceptons). 
The KO area is usually off to the side of the main battlefield, out of the way of the play but still visible. Note that characters may still be flipped as a part of your flip action, however they cannot be flipped by battle cards unless a card specifically states it can.
